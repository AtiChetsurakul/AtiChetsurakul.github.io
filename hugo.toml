At first, I join the university as non-major in science which aim to take the **mathematic major**.
Although I love mathematic, I still get excited when it a time for chemistry lab.
I join the chemistry major in thrid semester and focus in **Analytical chemistry**.

I have a project which got funded from **YSTP, NSTDA**
- In the topic of ` Micro-Solid Phase Extraction and Electrochemical Detection for Serotonin Monitoring`
  - This project invole in the extraction Serotonin from human urine for monitoring with cheap price and highly accurate.

With Analytical chemistry, I have specialize in linear algebra and looking forward for application.
In the end, I saw that this can be applied in to **deep learning** so I shift my interest into computer science
